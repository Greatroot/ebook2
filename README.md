# ebook2
Ben Kosa's FBLA Coding and Programming Prejudged Project

All of this source code was generated in Visual Studio 2017. 

If you want to see the full file structure of my application on Github, go to the Github page that you were originally sent to from the Google Document (https://github.com/Greatroot/ebook2) and click on the blue highlighted ebook2 link which is right above ".gitattributes."
You will be brought to a page with the entire file and folder structure of my application and you can then click on different folders and files to view them and their contents. 

If you want to copy the source code of this application and try it out for yourself, you must first install Visual Studio 2017 Community, which should be free. Once you have fully installed Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition go to https://github.com/Greatroot/ebook2, click on the clone or download button, and click "download ZIP." Open the zip file once it has been downloaded and extract or unzip the file. Once the ebook2-master folder has been unzipped, click on it to open it. You should then find a file labeled "ebook2.sln." Click on this file and it will open the application for you in your recently installed Visual Studio 2017 editor. From here you can click on the view ribbon and click "Solution Explorer." Once you have the Solution Explorer open, you can view all of the folders and files of the application and open them to view their contents. If you want to run the application, simply hit F5 or the green play button with the words "IIS Express" next to it.
